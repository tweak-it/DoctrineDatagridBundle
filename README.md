DoctrineDatagridBundle
==============

This bundle helps you to create and manage simple to complex datagrids quickly and easily. 

Unlike other similar bundle already available on github and/or packagist, there is no magic method that will render the datagrid in you view. This technical choice allow you to completely customize your datagrid aspect and render (filter fields, buttons, columns, data displayed in each column, pagination links and informations, etc.)

This make it easy to implement and use in both back-end and front-end applications.

Still skeptical ? Let's see how it works !

## Installation

### Get the code

Since composer is the simplest and fastest way to install dependencies, the only way to install this bundle automatically is to add the following line to your dependencies


	"require": {
    	...
    	"tweak-it/doctrine-datagrid-bundle": "dev-master"
    	...
	},
